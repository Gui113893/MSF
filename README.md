# MSF - Modelação de Sistemas Físicos
# MPS - Modeling of Physical Systems
### Final Grade: 15/20

## Objective
The objective of the curricular unit is for students to learn fundamental Physics concepts that allow an understanding of physical phenomena relevant to Computer Engineering, in an algorithmic approach.
Combining this theoretical knowledge with its computational implementation, it is intended that students acquire skills in the development of computational models with the aim of making numerical predictions or simulations that describe the behavior of systems of interest to Computer Engineering.

## Content
- Physics and measurement: quantities, units, standards;
- Newton's laws and numerical methods for solving differential equations;
- Conservation Laws: energy, linear momentum, angular momentum.
- Oscillations: damping; forced oscillators and resonance; coupled oscillators; normal modes and Fourier series;
- Mechanical waves;
- Particle systems, collisions;
- Chaotic systems;
- Dynamics of a rigid body
